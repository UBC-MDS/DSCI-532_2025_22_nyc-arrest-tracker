## Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios 

### Persona Description:

Name: John Doe
Role: Executive Leader, New York City Government
Background: John oversees public safety initiatives and uses data to assess the effectiveness of law enforcement programs. He focuses on policy, resource allocation, and crime reduction strategies.

### Overall Goal:

Johnâ€™s goal is to quickly access arrest metrics to evaluate initiatives, track crime trends, identify demographic and borough disparities, and inform future policy and resource allocation.

## User Story:

John logs into the dashboard to track the latest trends in arrests across New York City. He is particularly interested in understanding how arrest numbers are changing over time and whether there is a shift in the types of crimes being committed. 

His key tasks include:

- [Exploring] arrest trends by selecting specific days and months from the side menu. He can choose whether to display arrest coordinates or precinct coordinates on the interactive map.

- [Filtering] data by crime type using the dropdown menu to view specific categories such as assault, larceny, or drug-related crimes.

- [Examining] arrest patterns by borough or precinct. By clicking on specific regions on the interactive map, John can view a summary of arrests and crime types within those areas.

- [Tracking] arrest trends over time through the time-series density chart. This chart allows him to see how arrests have changed in recent months, and he can modify the time range using the sidebar.


- [Analyzing] the distribution of arrests by crime type with the bar chart to identify which offenses are most frequent.

- [Comparing] arrest data by gender and age group with interactive pie charts. These charts allow John to filter data and explore demographic patterns in the arrest data.

The dashboard includes:

- Side menu: Select day, month, crime type, and map coordinates.

- An interactive map of New York City that displays points corresponding to precincts. John can hover over the map and click on boroughs or precincts to view a summary of the arrest data for those regions.

- A time-series density chart that shows trends in arrests over the past few months. This chart is fully interactive, and John can modify it using the sidebar to adjust the time range and explore different patterns.

- Bar chart: Display the frequency of various crime types (e.g., assault, larceny, drug-related offenses), giving John a clear view of the distribution of crimes.

- Two pie charts: one comparing arrest data by gender and the other by age group. 

Based on this information, John might decide that the recent community outreach initiative in specific boroughs is working effectively. However, he may also realize that there is an increasing trend in drug-related offenses and that additional resources are needed to address these crimes. He will likely bring this data to the next executive meeting to discuss potential new strategies for combating drug-related crimes in the city.

This process allows John to make data-driven decisions, informing his strategy for future policies, resource allocation, and crime prevention efforts.
