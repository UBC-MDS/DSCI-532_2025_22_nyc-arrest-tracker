# Data Description

We will be using New York Police Department (NYPD) arrest record data to create visualizations, which could influence policy decisions. The dataset consists of 170,095 arrests during 2023. Each arrest record has 18 variables associated with it, which will we use to display the key information present in the data. These variables fall into the following groupings:

- **Arrest Information**: This includes the arrest date, time, and location.
- **Arrestee Information**: This includes age group, and sex of the arrestee.
- **Arrest Charges**: This includes the charges for which the arrestee was arrested.

We will use this data to create visualizations that will help us understand the distribution of arrests across different age groups, different charges, different locations around New York City. This will help us identify patterns and trends in the data, which could be useful for policy decisions.
