# NYPD Arrest Tracker Reflection 3

**Authors**: Michael Gelfand, Hala Arar, Michael Hewlett

## What has been implemented since milestone 2

- Working date range picker in sidebar
- Apply button for applying filters
- Reset button clears almost everything
- Created proper title and moved filter sidebar button to the right corner
- Fixed layout of pie charts on right side of screen
- Converted crime frequency pie chart to a bar chart
- Placeholder pie and bar charts to signify no data due to too much filtering

## What has not been implemented and why

- Density plot: Removed as it would make the dashboard too cluttered.
- Month slider: incorporated into the date selector.

## What is not working properly

- The reset button currently does not unselect the region from the map chart. Instead the only way to unselect a region is by clicking on the white area outside of the map. We have tried to implement this but it is proving difficult and will be fixed next milestone.
- We would like to have the map appear greyed out entirely when the filters result in empty dataframes. Current attempts resulted in it resetting the pie charts to show defaults instead of empty placeholders. Will be fixed next milestone.

## What the dashboard does well
