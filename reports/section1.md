### Project Authors
External data science consultancy

### Problem
The target audience wants to follow best practice in evidence-based policy. They have identified that key arrest statistics are an important outcome for several departments and initiatives. In the past each department relied on separate dashboards but to avoid reduplicated effort and reference a single set of metrics, an initiative was struck to develop a unified dashboard.

They have brought on our firm to build an easily and quickly digestible dashboard on arrests in NYC. They want to will use this dashboard to track the effect of their ongoing initiatives and to develop ideas for new projects.
